For the current "Key Insigt" section. I think the 3 cards now are not very useful.

I want to change them to the following:

"X-Year Snapshot Cards"

Think of them as three side-by-side KPI tiles that answer, in plain numbers,
“Where do I stand in Year X, how much cash did I spend getting there, and what explains the gap?”

Card	What the card shows	Sample numbers*	Why it helps the user
① Net-Worth @ Year 10	After selling the house (5 % agent fee) vs. cashing out the brokerage account.	Buy: $1.65 M  Rent + Invest: $4.55 M  Winner: Rent + Invest ▲ $2.90 M	Users see the answer first—no spreadsheet scanning needed.
② 10-Year Cash Outflows	Cumulative money that actually left your pocket.	Buy: $1.85 M  (mortgage + tax + up-keep + closing) Rent: $0.84 M	Highlights that leverage is expensive even before opportunity cost.
③ What Moved the Needle?	Quick breakdown of the drivers (no decimals).	• Stock CAGR 15 %  • Home CAGR 5 %  • Interest & property-tax $1.18 M  • Sale cost $0.20 M	Puts the result in context; teaches users why the lines diverged.

*Sample inputs used for the mock numbers—feel free to replace:
	•	Home price $2.5 M, 25 % down, 30-yr fixed 6.75 %
	•	Home appreciation 5 %/yr, rent $6 000/mo growing 5 %/yr
	•	Stock return 15 % CAGR, 10-year horizon
