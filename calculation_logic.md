整体计算逻辑：

1. 计算买房和租房的现金流，然后比较现金流。如果一个选项的当年支出比另一个选项的当年支出更多，则将多出的支出部分视为另一个选项的当年投资。
2. 在初始年，买房的首付和交易成本是买房的支出，租房的支出则是当年租金，所以买房的当年投资是 0，租房的当年投资则是首付和交易成本减去当年租金的剩余部分。
3. 对于后续年份，买房的当年支出是当年房贷还款以及当年房产税、保险和维修费用，租房的当年支出是当年租金，两种选项支出更低的选项可以将剩余部分视为当年投资。

对于两种选项的 net asset value，买房的 net asset value 是当年房产价值减去当年房贷余额（如果买房选项有投资的话，则再加上投资价值），租房的 net asset value 是累计投资价值。

Here’s the overall logic behind our calculator:

1. We calculate the cash flow for both buying and renting, then compare them. If one option’s expenses in a given year are higher than the other’s, the extra expense is treated as an investment in the other option for that year.
2. In the first year, the down payment and transaction costs count as expenses for buying, while rent is the expense for renting. So, the investment for buying that year is zero, and for renting, it’s the down payment and transaction costs minus that year’s rent.
3. For the following years, buying expenses include mortgage payments, property taxes, insurance, and maintenance, while renting expenses are just the rent. The option with lower expenses in a given year treats the leftover amount as an investment.

As for the net asset value:

- For buying, it’s the property value minus the mortgage balance for that year (plus any investment value if applicable).
- For renting, it’s the total accumulated investment value.

### Calculation Logic

**Core Principle:** We will calculate everything annually. For things like mortgages (paid monthly), we'll sum them up to an annual figure.

**I. Preliminary Calculations (Done Once):**

1. **Down Payment Amount:**
   - `down_payment_amount = property_price (a) * down_payment_percentage (b)`
2. **Loan Amount:**
   - `loan_amount = property_price (a) - down_payment_amount`
3. **Monthly Mortgage Payment:**
   - This requires the standard mortgage payment formula:
     `M = P [i(1 + i)^n] / [(1 + i)^n – 1]`
     Where:
     - `P = loan_amount`
     - `i = mortgage_interest_rate_annual (c) / 12` (monthly interest rate)
     - `n = mortgage_term_years (d) * 12` (total number of payments)
   - Let's call this `monthly_mortgage_payment`.
4. **Buying Closing Costs Amount:**
   - `closing_costs_buy_amount = property_price (a) * closing_costs_percentage_buy (e)`

**II. Annual Calculations (Loop from Year = 1 to N):**

For each year, we'll calculate the metrics for both "Buy" and "Rent & Invest" scenarios.

**A. BUY SCENARIO (for current `Year`)**

1. **Current Property Value (`current_year_property_value`):**

   - `current_year_property_value = property_price (a) * (1 + home_appreciation_cagr (i)) ^ Year`

2. **Mortgage Details for the Year:**

   - You'll need an amortization schedule (or a function that calculates it year by year). For the current `Year`:
     - `annual_interest_paid_this_year`: Sum of interest portions of the 12 monthly payments in this `Year`.
     - `annual_principal_paid_this_year`: Sum of principal portions of the 12 monthly payments in this `Year`.
     - `remaining_mortgage_balance_end_of_year`: Loan balance after payments of this `Year`.

3. **Annual Holding Costs:**

   - `annual_property_tax = current_year_property_value * property_tax_rate_annual (f)`
   - `annual_insurance_maintenance = current_year_property_value * insurance_and_maintenance_rate_annual (g)`
   - `annual_hoa = hoa_fee_annual (h)` (Assuming this is a fixed annual amount as per the input. If it were to grow, we'd need a growth rate for it.)
   - `total_annual_holding_costs = annual_property_tax + annual_insurance_maintenance + annual_hoa`

4. **Cash Outflow (Buy Scenario - for current `Year`):**

   - **If `Year == 1`:**
     `cash_outflow_buy = down_payment_amount + closing_costs_buy_amount + (monthly_mortgage_payment * 12) + total_annual_holding_costs`
   - **If `Year > 1`:**
     `cash_outflow_buy = (monthly_mortgage_payment * 12) + total_annual_holding_costs`
   - **Mortgage Interest Deduction Impact (if `k` is true):**
     `tax_savings_from_deduction = annual_interest_paid_this_year * marginal_tax_rate (j)`
     `adjusted_cash_outflow_buy = cash_outflow_buy - tax_savings_from_deduction`
     _(Note: For simplicity, we are assuming the full interest is deductible and directly reduces cash outflow. In reality, it reduces taxable income, and its value depends on being able to itemize beyond the standard deduction.)_

5. **Net Asset Value (Buy Scenario - "Not Cash Out" - at end of current `Year`):**

   - `net_asset_value_buy_not_cash_out = current_year_property_value - remaining_mortgage_balance_end_of_year`
   - This is essentially the Home Equity.

6. **Net Asset Value (Buy Scenario - "Cash Out" - at end of current `Year`):**
   - `selling_price = current_year_property_value`
   - `selling_costs_amount = selling_price * selling_costs_percentage_sell (l)`
   - `proceeds_before_tax_and_loan_repayment = selling_price - selling_costs_amount`
   - `capital_gain_on_property = selling_price - property_price (a)` (Initial purchase price)
   - `taxable_gain_on_property = max(0, capital_gain_on_property - tax_free_capital_gain_amount (n))`
   - `tax_on_property_gain = taxable_gain_on_property * long_term_capital_gains_tax_rate_property (m)`
   - `net_asset_value_buy_cash_out = proceeds_before_tax_and_loan_repayment - remaining_mortgage_balance_end_of_year - tax_on_property_gain`

**B. RENT & INVEST SCENARIO (for current `Year`)**

_Let's assume one investment option is chosen from `q` and its corresponding CAGR from `r` is used. Let's call it `selected_investment_cagr`._
_Also, we need to track the `investment_portfolio_value` year over year, and `total_cash_invested_so_far` for capital gains tax calculation on investment._

1.  **Initial Investment (Done once before Year 1 loop, or as part of Year 1 setup):**

    - The money _not_ spent on buying in Year 0 (or start of Year 1) is invested.
    - `initial_investment_amount = down_payment_amount + closing_costs_buy_amount`
    - Initialize `investment_portfolio_value = initial_investment_amount`
    - Initialize `total_cash_invested_so_far = initial_investment_amount`

2.  **Annual Rent Cost:**

    - `current_year_monthly_rent = current_monthly_rent_amount (o) * (1 + rent_growth_rate_annual (p)) ^ (Year - 1)`
    - `annual_rent_cost = current_year_monthly_rent * 12`

3.  **Cash Outflow (Rent Scenario - for current `Year`):**

    - `cash_outflow_rent = annual_rent_cost`

4.  **Differential Cash Flow for Investment:**

    - This is the difference between the _adjusted_ cash outflow of buying (considering tax savings) and renting for the current year. This amount is _added_ to the investment portfolio.
    - `additional_investment_this_year = adjusted_cash_outflow_buy (from Buy Scenario, step A4) - cash_outflow_rent`
    - *(Important: If `additional_investment_this_year` is negative, it means renting was more expensive in terms of cash flow for that year than buying. For simplicity, we can assume in this case that no additional funds are withdrawn from the investment to cover this, but simply that no *new* money is added from this differential. Or, for a more advanced model, you could have it draw down from the investment if desired. For now, let's assume `additional_investment_this_year = max(0, additional_investment_this_year)` if we only want to add positive savings.)*
      _A better approach is to always add this amount, even if negative, as it correctly reflects the funds available/needed relative to the buying scenario._

5.  **Investment Portfolio Growth:**

    - `portfolio_value_before_annual_growth = investment_portfolio_value (from end of last year, or initial amount if Year 1) + additional_investment_this_year`
    - `investment_return_this_year = portfolio_value_before_annual_growth * selected_investment_cagr`
    - `investment_portfolio_value_end_of_year = portfolio_value_before_annual_growth + investment_return_this_year`
    - Update `total_cash_invested_so_far = total_cash_invested_so_far + additional_investment_this_year` (only add the new cash, not returns)
    - Update `investment_portfolio_value` to `investment_portfolio_value_end_of_year` for the next iteration.

6.  **Net Asset Value (Rent & Invest - "Not Cash Out" - at end of current `Year`):**

    - `net_asset_value_rent_not_cash_out = investment_portfolio_value_end_of_year`

7.  **Net Asset Value (Rent & Invest - "Cash Out" - at end of current `Year`):**
    - `capital_gain_on_investment = investment_portfolio_value_end_of_year - total_cash_invested_so_far`
    - `taxable_gain_on_investment = max(0, capital_gain_on_investment)`
    - `tax_on_investment_gain = taxable_gain_on_investment * long_term_capital_gains_tax_rate_investment (s)`
    - `net_asset_value_rent_cash_out = investment_portfolio_value_end_of_year - tax_on_investment_gain`

**III. Presentation of Data:**

After running the loop from Year 1 to N, you will have the following data for each year:

1.  **For Buy Scenario:**
    - `cash_outflow_buy` (or `adjusted_cash_outflow_buy`)
    - `net_asset_value_buy_not_cash_out`
    - `net_asset_value_buy_cash_out`
2.  **For Rent & Invest Scenario:**
    - `cash_outflow_rent`
    - `additional_investment_this_year` (This is the _difference_ in cash outflows, which gets invested)
    - `net_asset_value_rent_not_cash_out`
    - `net_asset_value_rent_cash_out`

You can then present this in a table format, year by year:

| Year | Buy: Cash Outflow | Rent: Cash Outflow | Invested Amount (Rent Diff) | Buy: Net Asset (Not Cashed) | Buy: Net Asset (Cashed) | Rent: Net Asset (Not Cashed) | Rent: Net Asset (Cashed) |
| :--- | :---------------- | :----------------- | :-------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :---------------------- | :--------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| 1    | ...               | ...                | ...                         | ...                         | ...                     | ...                          | ...                      |
| 2    | ...               | ...                | ...                         | ...                         | ...                     | ...                          | ...                      |
| ...  | ...               | ...                | ...                         | ...                         | ...                     | ...                          | ...                      |
| N    | ...               | ...                | ...                         | ...                         | ...                     | ...                          | ...                      |

This structure should allow you to calculate and present the key data points you're interested in. Remember to handle the "Year 1" cash outflows (which include upfront costs) separately from subsequent years.

Long-term capital gains tax rates combined with the Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) vary by income level and filing status. Below is a breakdown of total rates for 2025, including the 3.8% NIIT where applicable:

## Total Long-Term Capital Gains Tax Rates (Including NIIT)

| Filing Status              | Taxable Income Range | LTCG Rate | NIIT Applies? | **Total Rate** |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | --------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| **Single**                 | $0 – $48,350         | 0%        | No            | 0%             |
|                            | $48,351 – $200,000   | 15%       | No            | 15%            |
|                            | $200,001 – $533,400  | 15%       | Yes           | 18.8%          |
|                            | Over $533,400        | 20%       | Yes           | 23.8%          |
| **Married Filing Jointly** | $0 – $96,700         | 0%        | No            | 0%             |
|                            | $96,701 – $250,000   | 15%       | No            | 15%            |
|                            | $250,001 – $600,050  | 15%       | Yes           | 18.8%          |
|                            | Over $600,050        | 20%       | Yes           | 23.8%          |
| **Head of Household**      | $0 – $64,750         | 0%        | No            | 0%             |
|                            | $64,751 – $200,000   | 15%       | No            | 15%            |
|                            | $200,001 – $566,700  | 15%       | Yes           | 18.8%          |

### Key Notes:

1. **NIIT Thresholds**:

   - Applies if Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) exceeds:
     - $200,000 (Single/Head of Household)
     - $250,000 (Married Filing Jointly) [1][6]
   - The 3.8% tax applies to the **lesser of**:
     - Net investment income, or
     - MAGI exceeding the threshold

2. **Exceptions**:

   - Collectibles (e.g., art, coins) and certain real estate gains may face higher rates (25-28%) [6]
   - State taxes may apply additionally (not included in table)

3. **Income Definitions**:
   - _Taxable income_ determines capital gains rate brackets
   - _MAGI_ determines NIIT applicability

This structure incentivizes long-term investing while ensuring high-income investors pay higher effective rates. For example, a single filer with $450,000 taxable income would pay 15% capital gains tax + 3.8% NIIT = 18.8% total on long-term gains [3][6].
